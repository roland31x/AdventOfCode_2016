My own solutions in C# ConsoleApp ( .NET 7.0 ) and PHP

### For C# simply load the solution in visual studio

### For PHP you need to run each php script using your own php version, just make sure you have enabled the openssl extension in php.ini
#### cd into the PHP folder using a command shell:
```
php day{number}.php
```

This will output the results.
